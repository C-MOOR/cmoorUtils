### Introduction: `r rmarkdown::metadata$title`

Insert a 3-5 sentence paragraph introducing the tutorial, e.g.

- What's the big picture goal?
- What major packages, functions, or pipelines will be covered, and what do they do?
- What dataset(s) will learners spend a lot of time with?
- Include a picture!

#### Learning Goals

```{r}
# Extract learning goals from YAML and add HTML tags to make an ordered list
learningGoals <- rmarkdown::metadata$learning_goals
learningGoals <- paste("<li>", learningGoals, "</li>", sep="", collapse="")

```

<ol>
`r learningGoals`
</ol>

#### Authors:

```{r}
# Extract authors from YAML and add HTML tags to make a list
authorList <- rmarkdown::metadata$author
authorList <- paste("<li>", authorList, "</li>", sep="", collapse="")

```

<ul>
`r authorList`
</ul>


```{r}
# Extract the tutorial version from the YAML data and store it so we can print it using inline r code below.  This can't be done directly inline because the code for extracting the YAML data uses backticks
tv <- rmarkdown::metadata$output$`learnr::tutorial`$version
```

#### Version: `r tv`

## Topic 1

### Exercise 

*Here's a simple exercise with an empty code chunk provided for entering the answer.*

Write the R code required to add two plus two:

```{r two-plus-two, exercise=TRUE}
```

### Exercise with Code

*Here's an exercise with some prepopulated code as well as `exercise.lines = 5` to provide a bit more initial room to work.*

Now write a function that adds any two numbers and then call it:

```{r add-function, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}
add <- function() {
  
}
```

## Topic 2

### Exercise with Hint

*Here's an exercise where the chunk is pre-evaulated via the `exercise.eval` option (so the user can see the default output we'd like them to customize). We also add a "hint" to the correct solution via the chunk immediate below labeled `print-limit-hint`.*

Modify the following code to limit the number of rows printed to 5:

```{r print-limit, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
mtcars
```

```{r print-limit-hint}
head(mtcars)
```

### Quiz

*You can include any number of single or multiple choice questions as a quiz. Use the `question` function to define a question and the `quiz` function for grouping multiple questions together.*

Some questions to verify that you understand the purposes of various base and recommended R packages:

```{r quiz}
quiz(
  question("Which package contains functions for installing other R packages?",
    answer("base"),
    answer("tools"),
    answer("utils", correct = TRUE),
    answer("codetools")
  ),
  question("Which of the R packages listed below are used to create plots?",
    answer("lattice", correct = TRUE),
    answer("tools"),
    answer("stats"),
    answer("grid", correct = TRUE)
  )
)
```
